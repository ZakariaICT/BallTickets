# Learning Outcomes

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 1 </ins>

####  Web Application: You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. 

User friendly You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques. 
Full-stack You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (JavaScript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g., Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

#### What does this learning outcome mean?

For this learning outcome i need to make a full-stack application. Which means on the end of this semester i need to have a website where i did put my requirments in and a website that uses  a front and back-end language.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?

##### Sprint 3 

I did make a frontend homepage already. I made this with HTML, CSS and JS code. This is the homepage:

Also i made a JAVA project where i did make a bit of code in. I now know how to make tables from my java code to my mssql database. I can do this because of my connection that i made in my code.

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 2 </ins>

#### Software equality: You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

Tooling and methodology Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 3 </ins>

#### You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

Choose You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

#### What does this learning outcome mean?

For this learning outcome i need to work within my group on a Agile way. This is a way to manage a project while breking it into several phases. The phases are: concept, inception, iteration, release, maintenance, and retirement.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?

For our project we use the Scrum method. This is a method within Agile that is characterised by cycles or stages of developmeent. We do this in sprints. We use GitHub for our schedules but also for our code. We have different branches that we work in so that the main code wont be affected and can't go wrong. Each sprint we make a sprint schedules in the begin and also a burndown chart. We make sprint schedules in GitHub but the burndownchart is made in Trello. Each sprint we have a different scrum master. Our product backlog is made in Trello, in this backlog you can find all things that need to be done for our project. Every day we start with a stand up where we discuss what we will do that day and what we want to have done.

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 4 </ins> 

#### CI/ CD: You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

Design and implement You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).


#### What does this learning outcome mean?

CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. This automates your software deleviry proces. So in my case i use Github and Github already has an extension that i can use for my CI/CD implementation. What i understand of CI is that my code will build, test and analyse as soon as i push my code to git when making a yml file. Also it makes it easier to automatically test my code because otherwise i need to do this manually. CD is the continuous deleviry. Herby i will make a docker repository where i will push my code in and make an image from this. CD helps with checking if my code is compatible for other devices such as apple or samsung and not only for windows.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?

##### Sprint 3 

Maven.YML File:

I made a maven.yml file for my CI in github. With this every time i push my code to git the code will be checked by git and it runs tests for me automatically. These tests must be made by myself in my code.

Docker push image:

Once my code has been build and checked then it will be pushed to docker to create an image. This happens automatically because of the code i wrote in the picture above. This is an example for 1 image. 


#### <ins> Learning Outcome 5 </ins>

#### You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

Recognize Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering. Take into account Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures; Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 6 </ins>

#### You analyse (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

Multiple types of test techniques You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.


#### What does this learning outcome mean?

For this learning outcome i need to make tests affter finising my code for by example a use case. Also i need to get feedback from my teachers.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 7 </ins>

#### You analyse and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.

Simple Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths. Related Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them). Business processes needed for the success of your software.


#### What does this learning outcome mean?

For this learning outcome i need to work with my gorup mates. We need to work on our project in the way a business process goes. So we need to take steps in making the application the company asked for.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?

#### <ins> Learning Outcome 8 </ins>

#### Professional: You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

Professional manner You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions. You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.


#### What does this learning outcome mean?

For this learning outcome i need to ask feedback to my stakeholders and also use these feedback and implement this in my project. I myself need to come with solutions on problems in my project but the stakeholders could help a little bit.
