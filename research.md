I did some research on JAVA and came to the conclusion that JAVA has been around here for a while.  JAVA Is just a language like c# where you can make software applications for yourself. Now I know a bit about JAVA and of course c# I thought like what is better for me to work with in this semester. I was looking for the best option where to make a website in. I based this research on a few criteria. Based on these criteria I come to the conclusion that the best language that suits my wishes for now is JAVA with a little bit. This comes out good because I really want to learn a new language.
Pros of JAVA that go along with my criteria:
-	It is easy to learn. It is easier to write, compile, debug than other languages.
-	JAVA is object oriented.
-	It is platform-independent.
-	It is secure.
 
Framework
So there are a lot of Frameworks in JAVA. You have got for example Spring, JSF, GWT or Play etc. 
I will look in to these frameworks while basing this on a few criteria.
Criteria
1.	Which framework is easy to learn?
2.	Which framework is easy to use?
3.	Which framework is most popular?
4.	Which framework is best to use for making a website?
5.	Which has the best performance?
6.	Which is easiest to work with a database?

Now looking at my criteria and based on my research the best framework for me to use is Spring. Spring scores best on most of my criteria so it compares to what I want to make this semester. So the framework I will use is Spring.
Pros of Spring that go along with my criteria:
-	It is flexible.
-	Fast
-	Secure
-	Productive
-	Easier Testing 
Frontend

Language
For the frontend I will use JavaScript. I am happy to be working with JS because I didn’t already worked with JS. Also JS is a really popular language. But for me the most important thin in a language is that is has to be a bit simple and JS is a simple language.

Framework
There are a lot of frameworks in JS such as REACT, Vue, Angular, Ember etc. I will look into these framework and base my research on a few criteria.
Criteria:
1.	Which suits best for making a website?
2.	Which has the best performance at the front end?
3.	Which framework is easy to learn?
4.	Which framework is easy to use?
5.	Which framework is most popular?
6.	Which framework goes best along with JAVA?
7.	Which framework is best for cross platform?

So based on my research I think the best framework for me to use is REACT. REACT scores best on all my criteria that I made before going into my research. The other frameworks are good to but the main reason I will work with react is because REACT is the most popular and has the most tutorials so I can learn this easily. There is more interest now for Angular but I think based on my research and looking into popularity now and in the past I go for REACT.
Pros of REACT that go along with my criteria:
-	Easy to learn and to use
-	Good performance
-	Good handy tools
